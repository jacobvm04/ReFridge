# ReFridge

Submission for the 2021 Samsung Solve for Tomorrow challenge from the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics.

My students intend to create ReFridge: an app that tracks usersâ€™ grocery purchases, identifies foods nearing their expiration dates, and generates recipes incorporating these items. Students would use machine learning, specifically Optical Character Recognition and Natural Language Processing, to retrieve items from a receipt, interpret abbreviations, and translate text to food item entries with known expiration dates.
Mac and Sherry will be the project managers for ReFridge. They will be responsible for leading weekly team meetings and setting goals for the project. Timothy will be the Machine Learning Lead for the project, and she will lead the creation of our computer vision and NLP models. David will be the Software Development Lead for the project - he will use Android Studio to design and create the app.

Phase Two Judging:
All eligible video submissions received, will be judged by a panel of qualified Judges
selected by Sponsor at its sole discretion.
Entries will be judged using the following judging criteria:
40% Project/video quality (clear, original and feasible)
30% STEM in solution demonstrated
20% Community impact
10% Sustainability Innovation (short and long term environmental impact)

Tech Stack:
Backend: Java, android studio, SQL
ML: Python, OpenCv, Tensorflow
Frontend: Figma design
Ops: Git, Github, Docker, Kubernates


Necessary Features (as per phase 1 application)
Notifications when food is likely going bad
Database of common expiration timelines of different commonly used food items (look at EatBy Date)(FoodKeeper by gov) - contact for a better data format??
Use database information to determine the average number of days until a food expires.
Option to edit expiration date
